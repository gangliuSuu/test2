# Assignment 1: Basic Python Functions

## Instructions

Complete the following functions in `main.py`:
- `add(a, b)`: Return the sum of `a` and `b`.
- `subtract(a, b)`: Return the difference between `a` and `b`.

## How to test

You can run the test file:

```bash
python -m unittest test_main.py
```

Your goal is to make all tests pass. Automatic grading will use the same test file.
